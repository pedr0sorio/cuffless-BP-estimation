# Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation

This project consists of estimating blood pressure measures from ECG and PPG data. It was part of the [PDSB](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/mebiom/disciplina-curricular/1529008500343) course of the 1st year/2nd semester of the [Master in Biomedical Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/mebiom) at [Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). The full and final minipaper can be found within this repository and also in [LaSEEB].

This repository holds all the essential MATLAB files for the running of a full pipeline of signal preprocessing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and estimation models.
Running the project is achieved by running the code in the MainScript.m file along with the subject's data which can be provided upon request.
